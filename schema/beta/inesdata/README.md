## Inesdata ML schema

The aim of this vocabulary is to create a lightweight, model-centric representation, based on fair4ml and hugging face model cards.

A first early version of the requirements for the vocabulary, and a first set of properties to implement it is available in the following link:
[https://github.com/oeg-upm/inesdata-ml-schema](https://github.com/oeg-upm/inesdata-ml-schema)

Requirements are available at [https://github.com/oeg-upm/inesdata-ml-schema/tree/main/requirements](https://github.com/oeg-upm/inesdata-ml-schema/tree/main/requirements)
